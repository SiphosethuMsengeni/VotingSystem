# Voting System Project

## Overview
This project is a voting system that consists of three primary components: a **Voting Server**, a **Database**, and **Voting Clients**. It allows users to vote, view results, and store voting data securely. The system is built using Java and utilizes Maven for dependency management and project building.

### Components:
- **Voting Server**: Handles the server-side logic of the voting system, processes votes, and communicates with the database.
- **Vote Database**: Stores votes and other relevant data for the system. It ensures consistency with lock files and logs.
- **Voting Clients**: Client-side applications used by voters to cast their votes.

## Features
- **Secure Voting**: Ensures that votes are accurately recorded and counted.
- **Real-time Vote Updates**: The system provides real-time updates of the voting results.
- **Database-backed**: All votes are securely stored in a database, ensuring data integrity.
